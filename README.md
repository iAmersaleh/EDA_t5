  T5 Project proposal
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


## Introduction:
The history of transportation starts from the age of humans and has continued to change over some time. The first means of transportation was the human foot.
The history of transport has undergone a radical change with the introduction of wheels. Existing means of transportation were continuously improved after that, for example, horse-drawn vehicles (carts or karts).
Until the gas and fuel cars were invented

Cars are one of the most important necessities for every family, as they are the most popular means of transportation these days.

This project aims to analyze the used car market in the UK, compare car prices by type, engine, and car model, for example, which cars are most in demand. With the presence of more than one car company.

We will do a comprehensive analysis to find the best used cars to attract customers so that our showrooms are among the best and we can achieve the company's goal and vision for development in the used car sectors

## Algorithms:
After we explore data, we will do data cleaning, pre-processing and delete the duplicate records and check if there are any null values then drop them. After that we will try to answer the questions we are looking for.

## Questions:
* What are the most popular used cars ?
* What is the most reliable feature that customers rely on when buying a used car ?
* What is the average customer budget when buying a used car ?
* what is the correlation between price and year, price and mileage ?

## Data Description:
The data set is provided in .csv format,  contains information of price, transmission, model, mileage, fuel type, road tax, miles per gallon (mpg), and engine size. 

The data set was extracted from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/adityadesai13/used-car-dataset-ford-and-mercedes
